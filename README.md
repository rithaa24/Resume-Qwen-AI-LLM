**A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating resume generation using the Qwen AI large language model.**

</div>

## üìñ Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a practical example of leveraging the Qwen AI large language model (LLM) to generate resumes.  The notebook showcases the process of prompting the model, handling its output, and potentially refining the generated resume.  It's intended for individuals interested in exploring the application of LLMs for resume creation and automation.

## ‚ú® Features

- Demonstrates prompting techniques for Qwen AI to generate resume content.
- Shows basic handling and formatting of the LLM's text output.
- (Potentially) Includes methods for refining the generated resume (this would depend on the content of `Resume.ipynb`).


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  (To be determined based on detailed inspection of `Resume.ipynb`) Likely includes libraries for interacting with Qwen AI and potentially for data manipulation/formatting.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (version will depend on the notebook's requirements, check `Resume.ipynb`)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary libraries (specified in the notebook or potentially a `requirements.txt` file -  if present, installation instructions should be added here.  If not, list the libraries found in `Resume.ipynb`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rithaa24/Resume-Qwen-AI-LLM.git
   cd Resume-Qwen-AI-LLM
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:** (Adapt based on the discovered dependencies)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If requirements.txt exists
   # Otherwise, manually install based on the libraries identified in Resume.ipynb
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook:**
   Start Jupyter Notebook and open `Resume.ipynb`.

4. **Run the Notebook:**
   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to generate a resume.
